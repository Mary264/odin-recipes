     <h2> Description </h2>

        <p> An American childhood favorite, Peanut Butter and Jelly or PB and J sandwich is sandwich 
            you will not be able to stop eating. Who knew that a sandich just made up of two ingrediants would be beloved by so many.
            Even as a young preschooler when asked what did I love the most about my mom, I said it was her pb and j sandwiches.</p>
        
        <p> Peanut butter and Jelly sandwiches are so famous that they even have their own song "It's peanut butter jelly time." And 
            when I was abroad in England my friends requested that I make them pb and j sandwiches. While some people may think they are
            saving money by buying peanut butter and jelly already mixed in a jar the quality is terrible. You don't want to be cheep on this reciepe</p> 
        
        <p> Also it is argued that pb and j sandwiches cut diagonally taste much better!</p>
