        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> What actually makes something "New York style" I have no idea. Since my aunt was the first person to introduce me to these sandwiches
                and since she lives in New York, I guess this is why I consider it to be New York Style. Then again this recipe isn't any different
                from any other scrambled eggs and toast. Oh well my webpage, my recipe.  
            </p>

            <p> What are you waiting for, go on and try this recipe for yourself! It should takes less than 10 mins. And it is perfect to eat 
                in the mornings,lunch or before taking a four hour bus ride home.
            </p>
